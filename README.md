### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;I'm Jack

- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp; Ask me about how to get involved in the HPC community as a student or early-career engineer/developer/researcher.
- ðŸ“« &nbsp; How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackcmorrison/) is best.
- âš¡ &nbsp; Fun fact: I have a small collection of decomissioned supercomputing hardware, including a piece of the [Cray-1 from LLNL (1975)](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102675086) and a node from [Intrepid](https://www.top500.org/system/176322/), the BG/P system installed at ANL in 2008. If anyone has a Titan node, I'm in the market for one!
